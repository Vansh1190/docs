Easy Peasy is an abstraction of Redux, providing a reimagined API that focuses on developer experience. It allows you to quickly and easily manage your state.

## Why We Need Global State Management

In a complex application, managing state can become challenging as the application grows. Global state management provides a centralized way to handle state across different components, making it easier to maintain and update the state consistently. Here are some reasons why global state management is essential:

1. **Consistency**: With a global state, all components share the same state, ensuring that the data is consistent across the application.
2. **Ease of Access**: Any component can access the global state without the need to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree.
3. **Simplified State Updates**: Actions and reducers in global state management libraries like Easy Peasy provide a clear and structured way to update the state, reducing the risk of bugs.
4. **Scalability**: As the application grows, global state management helps in scaling the state management logic without significant refactoring.

By using Easy Peasy, we leverage these benefits while enjoying a simplified and developer-friendly API for managing our application's state.

## How we are using Easy Peasy .
Inside `src/app/lib/store` folder, we have a file named as `store.js`. In that file we have created a store. it contains the global states and actions of the project.
There is different states and actions for different features of the project.

```js
// State
User: {},

// Actions
setUser: action((state, payload) => {
    state.User = payload;
}),

```
<Note>  
**State:** is the name of the state that is used to store the data.

**Actions:** are the functions that we are using to update the state.
</Note>



## How to use the store in the project.
we need to wrap the app component with the store provider, to make the store available to the whole application. we made an `CustomStoreProvider` component to wrap the app component with the store provider and pass the store as a prop to the `CustomStoreProvider` component.

```js
import store from "src/app/lib/store";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    // ... other components     
    <body>
      <CustomStoreProvider store={store}>
        // ... other components
        {children}
      </CustomStoreProvider>
    </body>
  );
}
```

## How to use the state and actions in the project.
we can use the state and actions in the project by using the `useStoreState` and `useStoreActions` hooks.

```js
import { useStoreState, useStoreActions } from "easy-peasy";

const user = useStoreState((state) => state.User);
const setUser = useStoreActions((actions) => actions.setUser);

// ...

```
